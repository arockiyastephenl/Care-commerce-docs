Next, the platform service provider based in this way the buyer and seller cannot connect directly, through the platform service provider (Flipkart.com,etc.) only they connect. Product price includes service charges of platform service providers also the price also fixed by the platform service provider only. Every aspect of selling is taken care of by the platform owner but sellers having following pain points getting profit , brand name cannot be shown and sellers get money after delivering the product only. 

In the next way, using the ready-made web store building application in this way stores are only built by the predefined framework based, but other services that must be taken care of by the seller that is marketing, payment and logistics.
