Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) is a market-led initiative to enable interoperability in digital commerce. Based on the principles of openness, it aims to enable the unbundling of digital commerce, democratization of digital commerce, and unlocking value for all parts of digital commerce, as well as enable innovation to open the next chapter of digital commerce.

ONDC uses asynchronous APIs that buyer apps and seller apps need to integrate in order to use the network. The APIs that start with on_ are callback APIs/webhooks.

Example. The buyer app calls the search API to search for an offer. Once this call is sent, the buyer app will receive a unique ID in response. Now the on_search hook of the buyer app is called by the network to provide the seller search result.

## How does it work?â€‹

ONDC is not a website or app, it is a network. An open network built on top of the Beckn protocol, allowing any buyer/seller/logistics partner/credit provider, etc. to communicate with each other in a standardized language. This, in turn, makes the ecosystem open to everyone's participation. So every buyer can use a buyer app to search for products/services and sellers can list their offers and deliver orders.

## Benefits of ONDC?
 
Here are the points about the benefits of ONDC:
1. Improved Access to Customers: By connecting to the ONDC platform, businesses can reach a wider audience and expand their customer base beyond their local market.                     
2. Lower Transaction Costs: ONDC aims to lower the costs associated with online transactions by creating a common infrastructure that businesses can use instead of building their own.
3. Improved efficiency: The platform aims to simplify and streamline e-commerce activities, which could help companies save time and money on administrative tasks. Increased Transparency: ONDC aims to bring more transparency to e-commerce transactions, which could help build trust between buyers and sellers.                                                                                                                                         
4. Fosters Innovation: By providing a common infrastructure, ONDC could encourage innovation and collaboration between companies, which could lead to the development of new products and services.      


Overall, ONDC has the potential to offer multiple benefits to businesses, particularly small and medium-sized businesses. The shared infrastructure could simplify and streamline e-commerce activities and allow companies to save time and money on administrative tasks. Greater transparency in e-commerce transactions facilitated by ONDC could help build trust between buyers and sellers, while the shared infrastructure could encourage collaboration and innovation between companies and lead to the development of new products and services. Although ONDC is still in its early stages of development, it has the potential to boost the e-commerce sector in India and drive economic growth.
