Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) is a market-led initiative aimed at enabling interoperability in Digital Commerce.
Based on the principles of Openness, it aims to enable unbundling Digital Commerce, democratising Digital Commerce and unlock value for all parts of Digital Commerce, as well as enable innovation to unlock the next chapter of Digital Commerce. — ONDC LinkedIn

ONDC uses async APIs, which buyer apps and seller apps have to integrate to use the network.The APIs starting with on_ are callback APIs/webhooks.

Example. The buyer app will call search API to search an offering. Once this call is sent, the buyer app will get a unique id in response. Now the on_search hook of the buyer app will be called by the network to provide the result of the search from the sellers.

## How does it work?​

ONDC is not a website or an app but it's a network. An open network built on top of Beckn protocol that makes it possible for any buyer/seller/logistics partner/credit provider, etc. to communicate with each other in a standardized language.Which in turn makes the ecosystem open for anyone to participate.So any buyer can use a buyer app to search for any products/services and sellers can list their offerings and serve orders.
