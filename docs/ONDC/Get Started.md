Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) requires you to follow a few key steps. First, register as a seller by providing basic business information such as your company name, address and tax ID. Next, integrate your existing systems with ONDC's APIs to enable seamless communication between your systems and the platform. Once the integration is complete, list your products on ONDC by providing detailed descriptions, images, and pricing information. Please set up your payment gateway by integrating with the ONDCs APIs and configuring payment settings. Finally, you can efficiently manage orders by editing and updating their status and communicating with buyers when needed. Skills in technical integration, product listing, and order management are required to successfully onboard to ONDC.
